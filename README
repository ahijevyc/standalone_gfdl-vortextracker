I compiled standalone_gfdl-vortextracker_v3.9a relatively easily on cheyenne with intel compiler. 

But the dav cluster took some effort.  Unfortunately, the dav cluster does not allow one of the  prerequisite modules to be installed because netcdf and hdf5 cannot be loaded simultaneously.

You will get errors with -ldl not found  or -ljpeg not found

/glade/u/apps/dav/os/usr/lib64/libdl.a(dlsym.o): In function `dlsym':
(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `__dlsym'

But I got it to compile with either hdf5 or netcdf missing IF I added the jpeg library to the compile command before the z, png, and jasper libraries. 

I found the easiest way to do this was to edit arch/preamble and  set
GRIB2_LIBS      =   -L/usr/lib64 -ljpeg CONFIGURE_TRACKER_LIBS
Perhaps this is the wrong way; but it worked. 
TODO: avoid editing arch/preamble and just add to configure command: # does not work ./configure GRIB2_LIBS='-L/usr/lib64 -ljpeg'


And configure option 2 (intel serial)
To fix it, cd trk_src/gettrk. Rerun the ifort command with "-L/usr/lib64 -ljpeg" before -L/glade/u/apps/dav/os/usr/lib64 -lz -lpng -ljasper stuff.
Same with vint, and tave.

tested 2 executables on cheyenne
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ahijevyc ncar 8194080 Jan 11 15:09 /glade/work/ahijevyc/standalone_gfdl-vortextracker_v3.9a/trk_exec/gettrk.exe
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ahijevyc ncar 3152584 Jan 11 14:28 /glade/u/home/ahijevyc/bin_cheyenne/gettrk.exe

thought the bigger one might be faster. (configure option 2.  Linux x86_64, Intel compiler	 (serial))
It was but not by much.
bigger             vs smaller 
2682.412u 366.600s vs 2697.396u 407.908s <- output from "time" command run with GFS 2018103100 tcgen

Man! Super-debug executable is 11MB? 

Tried SGI MPT also. Seems to be going slower than serial.It was the same.
